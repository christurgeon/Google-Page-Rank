# Google-Page-Rank
This program first constructs an adjacency matrix graph from random generation or from a .dat file. It takes in a command line argument from the user saying which graph to run the algorithms on. The two included algorithms are a T step random walk and an iterative algorithm. 

## Command Line Arguments
```python3 page_ranks.py```

## Choosing Graphs
The program will ask for the user to enter ```dat``` if the user wants to use a graph from the ```.dat``` file. Enter any other key or word if you do not desire to use the ```.dat``` file and instead want to randomly generate a graph.
